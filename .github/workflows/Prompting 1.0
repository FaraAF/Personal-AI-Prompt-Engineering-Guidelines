# First iteration of prompting guidelines that I developed through the use of Claude and utilizing NirDiamant/Prompt_Engineering Repo as source material#

Practical Implementation Guide
Scenario 1: Designing a New Specialized Prompt
Step 1 - Domain Research (Deep Research, 5 minutes)

text
Query: "Research [domain topic] comprehensively, including current best practices, 
key terminology, common frameworks, and expert methodologies for 2025"
Export the report for reference.

Step 2 - Prompt Architecture Design (Pro Search with Claude 4.5 Sonnet, 15-30 minutes)

text
Paste Master Prompt Engineer framework + research findings
Request: "Design a comprehensive prompt for [use case] using the tier-based 
framework, incorporating the domain research provided"
Iterate conversationally to refine.

Step 3 - Documentation (Labs, 5 minutes - Optional)

text
Request: "Create a structured document with the final prompt, implementation 
guide, and usage instructions formatted for easy reference"
Scenario 2: Analyzing Why an Existing Prompt Fails
Use Pro Search exclusively:

text
1. Paste Master Prompt Engineer framework
2. Provide the failing prompt
3. Request: "Analyze this prompt's weaknesses using the tier framework, 
identify failure modes, and provide 3 improved versions"
4. Iterate based on results
No need for Deep Research or Labs here.

Scenario 3: Building a Prompt Engineering Knowledge Base
Use Labs to organize:

text
Request: "Create a comprehensive spreadsheet organizing all prompt engineering 
techniques from the tier framework with columns for: Technique Name, Tier, 
Use Cases, Example Implementation, Effectiveness Rating, When to Avoid"
Quick Decision Tree
Are you designing/refining/analyzing a prompt?
→ Use Pro Search (Claude 4.5 Sonnet)

Do you need comprehensive research about a domain before building the prompt?
→ Use Deep Research first, then switch to Pro Search

Do you need to create a spreadsheet, report, or dashboard organizing your prompt work?
→ Use Labs

Are you having a back-and-forth conversation iterating on prompt design?
→ Use Pro Search (best conversational experience)

Bottom Line for Your Master Prompt Engineer Use
Default Mode: Pro Search with Claude 4.5 Sonnet (90% of time)

Best for iterative prompt design

Gives you model control

Conversational refinement

Search capabilities when needed

Unlimited access with your Pro plan

Strategic Mode: Deep Research (5-10% of time)

Domain investigation before specialized prompt creation

Comprehensive technique research

Competitive analysis of prompt engineering approaches

Always export reports for your reference library

Organizational Mode: Labs (5% of time)

Creating prompt template libraries

Building evaluation frameworks

Documenting your prompt engineering system

Organizing techniques into structured resources

Start every prompt engineering session in Pro Search with Claude 4.5 Sonnet—it's your primary workspace. Switch to Deep Research only when you need 
an autonomous, comprehensive domain investigation. Use Labs sparingly for creating structured deliverables.
