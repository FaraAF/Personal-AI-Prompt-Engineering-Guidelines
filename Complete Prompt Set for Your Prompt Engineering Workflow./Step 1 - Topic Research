Usage Notes: Paste this into Deep Research mode, replace [DOMAIN TOPIC] 
with your specific subject (e.g., "CompTIA Security+ exam preparation and hands-on 
cybersecurity skills development" or "Frank Zane bodybuilding philosophy and aesthetic 
physique training"). Wait 2-4 minutes for comprehensive results, then 
export to PDF.
